#  Project Brief
# Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project


Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the
world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime,
the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to
launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.


Data Analyst has been hired by Rockbuster Stealth’s business intelligence (BI)
department to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service. The BI
department helps other departments, from inventory to customer insights, with data-related
queries. Data Analyst first task is to load all of Rockbuster’s data into a relational database
management system (RDBMS). Then, you’ll use SQL to analyze the data and answer any
ad-hoc business questions that other departments may have.

Before Data Analyst can begin analysis and answer more complex business questions he
needs to acquire a good understanding of the various data points. And eventually compile
the results of your analysis into an easily digestible format, which will be presented to the
Rockbuster Stealth Management Board.



## Key Questions and Objectives

The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and
they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are
the main questions they’d like to answer:

● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
● What was the average rental duration for all videos?
● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?


## Context

To answer the questions posed by the different departments, Data Analyst query the data using SQL
(short for structured query language). Throughout this Achievement, Data analysy learn SQL
incrementally, and will use it to answer increasingly complex business questions for each
task. The results of the analysis will be presented to Rockbuster management, so it requires
to visualize the data in an easy-to-consume manner. 

The object of this project is to develop skills that could be applied to any industry and will highlight 
the ability to solve variety of clients. The aim is to give hands on experience with SQL.


## Data Set
In this Achievement, you’ll be using a data set that contains information about Rockbuster’s
film inventory, customers, and payments, among other things. The first thing you’ll need to
do is load the data set into the PostgreSQL database. Keep in mind the following points
regarding the data set:
● It’s around 3MB and contains several files.
● A relationship exists between two tables if a column name is present in both tables.


## Final Analysis Criteria for the project
Final project will be evaluated on your ability to:

● Write moderately complex SQL queries to answer business questions.
● Present your SQL results to business managers by creating visualizations and telling
a compelling story.
● Present SQL results to technical colleagues using Excel and by creating a
data dictionary.
● Create a professional project that can add to portfolio and show to
employers.
